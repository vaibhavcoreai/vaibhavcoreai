## 🚀 About Me

I’m a student and builder who believes learning hits different when you **ship real things**.

I’m currently focused on:
- Strengthening **foundations** (Python, SQL, Statistics)
- Building **real-world apps** for students & institutions
- Exploring how **AI intersects with human behavior & psychology**
- Turning ideas into **systems, not just code snippets**

I don’t rush.  
I **upgrade step by step**.
